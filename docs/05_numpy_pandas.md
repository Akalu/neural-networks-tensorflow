## NumPy

NumPy is an open source library available in Python that aids in mathematical, scientific, engineering, and data science programming. 

NumPy includes many useful tools that deal with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. On top of the arrays and matrices, NumPy supports a large number of mathematical operations.

NumPy is memory efficiency, meaning it can handle the vast amount of data more accessible than any other library; both TensorFlow and Scikit use NumPy to compute the matrix multiplication in the back end.

## Pandas

Pandas is an opensource library that allows to you perform data manipulation in Python. Pandas library is built on top of Numpy, meaning Pandas needs Numpy to operate. Pandas provide an easy way to create, manipulate and wrangle the
data. Pandas is also an elegant solution for time series data.

### Terminology

**Data frame** is a two-dimensional array, with labeled axes (rows and columns). A data frame is a standard way to store data.

**8eries** is a one-dimensional data structure. It can have any data structure like integer, float, and string. It is useful when you want to perform computation or return a one-dimensional array. A series, by definition, cannot have multiple columns. 

NOTE: for graphs plot functionality it might be necessary to install matplotlib into working environment:

```
pip install matplotlib
```
